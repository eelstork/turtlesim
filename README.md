# TurtleSim

A turtle simulator for 'tortle jam'

## Concept

The concept of this jam game is inspired from OctoDad but for turtles:
- `LB/RB`, `LT/RT` maps turtle legs
- `Y/A` maps turtle head and tail
- Left joystick should map the angle of the shell.
- Right joystick probably to move the camera.
- Optionally, other things such as biting food.
